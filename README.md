## 🎯 What is Access Context Fuzzer?

**Access Context Fuzzer** is a Burp Suite extension designed for security researchers and penetration testers who need to systematically test for **access control bypass** and **Web Cache Deception (WCD)** vulnerabilities.

Instead of manually crafting dozens of header and path variations, this extension **automatically generates and tests hundreds of bypass variants** in seconds — then highlights exactly which ones behave differently from the baseline.

## 🌟 What's New in v2.4.0

**Web Cache Deception — detection that actually confirms**
- 🐛 **Critical: Turkish-locale `toUpperCase()`/`toLowerCase()` broke all cache detection.** On a Turkish-locale JVM, `"hit".toUpperCase()` yields `"HİT"` (dotted capital İ, U+0130) — so `xCache.toUpperCase().contains("HIT")` was always `false`, and the same trap silently broke `private` → `prıvate` and `no-store` matching. Every `X-Cache` / `Cache-Control` / `Vary` comparison in `ScanEngine` and `HttpUtils` now uses `Locale.ROOT`. This is why cacheable responses were reported as `MISS` even though every resend was really a `HIT`.
- 🎯 **`/` delimiter for path-mapping WCD:** The Delimiter + Extension phase now also tests `/path/abc.js` (the exact vector behind PortSwigger's *"Exploiting path mapping"* lab), not just query/encoded delimiters.
- 🔁 **Automatic MISS→HIT confirmation:** When a variant returns a cacheable `200` `X-Cache: MISS` with `max-age`/`s-maxage`, the scanner resends the *same* request a few times inside the cache window. If `X-Cache` flips to `HIT`, the row is flagged **`🎯 WCD CONFIRMED (MISS→HIT)`** and shown as `HIT ✅` — the cache-warming step is now automatic instead of a manual Repeater round-trip.

**Verify WCD — warm + no-auth replay**
- 🔓 **Rewritten `Verify WCD` (right-click):** The old one-shot no-auth replay produced false negatives (a cold cache returns `302 / MISS` even on a cacheable URL). It now (1) **warms** the cache with your current auth until the entry is `HIT`, then (2) **replays without cookies/auth** and compares bodies. A confirmed leak requires a no-auth `HIT` whose body matches the authenticated response (or contains sensitive data) — cleanly separating `✅ CONFIRMED WCD` from `⚠️ HIT but content differs` and `❌ not cached without auth`. Works on whichever message (request **or** response) is open.

**New: 🎯 WCD Findings tab**
- 🗂️ A dedicated tab collects every WCD result — both the scanner's automatic MISS→HIT confirmations and manual verifications — with URL, auth/no-auth status, `X-Cache`, verdict, and timestamp. **Double-click a row to open the request/response that proves it.** No more transient popups with no history.

**UI & reporting**
- 🏷️ **Status moved to a proper label:** The cramped, text-truncated progress bar now shows just the bar; the run summary lives in a clean label — `✅ Done — N sent | M findings | B 🎯 bypass | W 🎯 WCD cacheable | Re-run available`.
- 🎯 **Cache HITs count as findings:** Confirmed MISS→HIT results are now included in the bypass tally and surfaced via a dedicated *WCD cacheable* counter (previously always reported `0 bypasses`).
- 🔎 **Tightened "interesting":** Only real findings (bypass, WCD confirmed, cache-hit, sensitive data, custom-rule hits) count as *interesting* and pass the *Show Only Interesting* filter — baseline noise (`STATUS_CHANGE` / `WORD_DELTA` / `LEN_DELTA` / `X-Cache:miss`) no longer inflates the count.
- 🌐 **English dialogs:** The WCD verification and scan-summary dialogs are now fully English.

**Settings**
- ⚙️ **OPSEC & Network moved to Settings:** The *Check External IP* / *Delay* panel was removed from the Header, Path, and Selection tabs and consolidated into a single section at the top of **Settings & History**, separated from per-engine payload options.
- 💾 **Single, persisted delay:** The three per-engine delays are unified into one `Delay (ms)` that all engines share and that is saved across restarts (key `acf.delay`; a legacy `acf.path.delay` is migrated automatically).

## 🌟 What's New in v2.3.2

**Bug Fixes**
- 🐛 **Swing EDT violations in scan startup:** `startFuzzing()` ran on a background thread but read `JTextArea`, `JSpinner`, and `JCheckBox` values directly — a race condition with the EDT. All UI values are now snapshotted via `ScanConfig` on the EDT before the task is submitted.
- 🐛 **Swing EDT violations in context-menu handlers:** Payload builders (`HeaderPayloadBuilder`, `PathPayloadBuilder`, `SelectionPayloadBuilder`) were being constructed inside the executor lambda, reading multiple `JCheckBox` components off the EDT. Builders are now called on the EDT before task submission.
- 🐛 **`flashTab` Timer created off EDT:** The `javax.swing.Timer` inside `flashTab()` was being constructed and started from the background fuzzing thread. Wrapped in `SwingUtilities.invokeLater()`. Additionally, the `JTabbedPane.indexOfComponent()` and `getTitleAt()` reads that fed `flashTab()` were themselves still on the background thread — moved inside the `invokeLater` lambda so all Swing reads happen on the EDT.
- 🐛 **DiffDialog false diff on CRLF responses:** `split("\n")` left trailing `\r` on each element when responses used Windows line endings, causing identical lines to appear as "changed". Changed to `split("\r?\n")`.
- 🐛 **Invalid custom rule regex silently discarded:** A bad pattern in the Custom Detection Rules panel was swallowed by `catch (Exception ignored)` with no feedback. Now logged to Burp's output panel.
- 🐛 **`btnPreview` useless executor roundtrip:** The Preview Payloads button submitted to the background thread pool only to immediately dispatch back to the EDT via `invokeLater`. Removed the intermediate hop.
- 🐛 **Duplicate `buildOpsecPanel` / `createTextAreaPanel` in every tab:** `HeaderEngineTab`, `PathEngineTab`, and `SelectionEngineTab` each declared private copies of methods already defined as `public static` in `ResultsPanel`. All three now delegate to the canonical implementations.
- 🐛 **`historyModel.getRowCount()` off EDT in scan history:** `appendScanHistory()` read `DefaultTableModel.getRowCount()` from the background fuzzing thread to compute the next row number, then wrapped only `addRow()` in `invokeLater`. Both the read and the write are now inside the `invokeLater` lambda.
- 🐛 **Parallel-mode timeout leaves HTTP request running:** On a `TimeoutException`, the timed-out `Future` was left running — the underlying HTTP connection stayed open until the remote server closed it. `future.cancel(true)` is now called before creating the fallback `FuzzResult`.
- 🐛 **`Desktop.getDesktop().browse()` blocking on EDT:** The About tab's hyperlink listener called `Desktop.browse()` directly on the Event Dispatch Thread. This is a blocking OS call that can freeze the entire Burp UI. Moved to a dedicated daemon thread.
- 🐛 **Custom path/payload/header `split("\\n")` broken on Windows:** Newlines typed in the Custom Paths (Path engine), Custom Payloads (Selection engine), Custom IPs, and Custom Headers (Header engine) text areas use `\r\n` on Windows. Splitting on `\n` left a trailing `\r` on each entry, producing payloads or header values with literal carriage-return characters. Changed to `split("\\r?\\n")` in all four locations.
- 🐛 **Hardcoded `User-Agent: AccessContext/3.0` in OPSEC check:** The IP-verification request to api.ipify.org sent a stale hardcoded version string. Now reads `ExtensionContext.VERSION` so the UA always matches the installed release.

**Performance**
- ⚡ **Single `bodyToString()` call per response:** `wordCount`, `lineCount`, `getTitle`, `detectSensitiveData`, and `bodyHash` each called `rr.response().bodyToString()` independently — up to 5 redundant body conversions per variant. A `bodyStr()` helper now fetches the body once per response; all analysis methods accept the pre-fetched string via overloaded signatures.
- ⚡ **ThreadLocal `MessageDigest` for MD5 hashing:** `MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5")` triggered a security-provider lookup on every call. Replaced with a `ThreadLocal<MessageDigest>` that is reused (`md.reset()`) across calls on the same thread — zero lookups after warm-up.
- ⚡ **`ThemeColors.isDark()` result cached:** Every table cell repaint called `UIManager.getColor("Panel.background")` through `isDark()`. The result is now cached in a `volatile boolean` and refreshed only when the Look & Feel changes via a `UIManager` property listener.

---

## 🌟 What's New in v2.3.1

**Bug Fixes**
- 🐛 **Session drift dialog (EDT fix):** The mid-scan confirmation dialog was being called via `JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog()` directly from the background fuzzing thread. Replaced with `SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait()` — potential deadlock on certain JVM/OS combinations.
- 🐛 **Null body crash in `bodyHash()`:** `.body()` returns null on 204/HEAD responses. Was silently swallowed by the catch block but still caused unnecessary exception overhead. Added an explicit null check.
- 🐛 **CSV newline escaping:** Multi-flag Notes entries contain embedded `\n` characters. These weren't being escaped before writing, breaking row boundaries in Excel and most CSV parsers.

**Performance**
- ⚡ **Regex pre-compilation:** Custom detection rules (Settings tab) were calling `Pattern.compile()` on every response — O(variants × rules) compilations per scan. Rules are now compiled once at scan start into a cached `List<Pattern>`.
- ⚡ **Allocation-free word/line counting:** `wordCount()` was doing `body.split("\\s+").length` — allocates a full `String[]` just to discard it. Replaced with `StringTokenizer.countTokens()`. `lineCount()` similarly replaced with a single-pass `char` loop.
- ⚡ **`getTitle()` static pattern:** `Pattern.compile()` was called on every invocation. Moved to a `private static final` field.

---

## 🌟 What's New in v2.3.0

- 📊 **Cache Status Column:** Results table now has a dedicated **Cache** column showing `HIT ✅`, `MISS`, `PRIVATE 🚫`, `NO-STORE 🚫`, `HIT/Vary:Cookie`, or the raw `X-Cache` value. WCD triage without reading the Notes column.
- 🌐 **CDN Profile Selector:** Pick your target's CDN (Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly, CloudFront, Nginx, Varnish) in the Path engine. Delimiter payloads are filtered to that CDN's known delimiter set — less noise, more signal.
- 🏋️ **Fat GET:** New checkbox in Path engine. Sends the request as a GET with a body. CDNs key the cache on path and ignore the body; some origins behave differently. Surfaces WCD vectors that path-only testing misses.
- 🗂️ **Extended Static Extensions:** Delimiter + Extension phase now covers 19 file types (was 6): `.js .css .png .jpg .gif .ico .woff .woff2 .svg .ttf .eot .mp4 .webp .avif .pdf .xml .json .txt .html`.
- 🔬 **Normalization Discrepancy Extras:** Four additional Norm Discrepancy payloads: `%252F` (double-encoded slash), BOM + extension, `%00.css` (null byte), `%c0%af` (overlong UTF-8).
- 🔑 **Sensitive Data Detection:** Every response body is automatically scanned for JWT tokens, CSRF tokens, email fields, Bearer tokens, and API keys. Matches are flagged as `SENSITIVE_DATA:JWT` (etc.) in Notes and highlighted pink. Confirms WCD exploitation when an unauthenticated cache replay returns sensitive content.
- 📋 **WCD Scan Summary:** After a Path engine scan, a popup summarises cache findings — HIT count, private/no-store count, Vary:Cookie count, and which specific variants look exploitable.
- 🔓 **Verify WCD (No-Auth):** New right-click context menu item. Replays the URL without cookies or auth headers in a fresh connection. If the cached response still returns authenticated content, it's a confirmed WCD finding — shown in a before/after comparison dialog.
- 🏗️ **Internal Refactor (1 file → 17 files):** The monolithic `AccessContextFuzzer.java` (was ~2000 lines) is now a proper multi-package structure: `burp.core`, `burp.util`, `burp.payload`, `burp.ui`. No behaviour changes — the entry point is now 123 lines. Makes contributing significantly more approachable.

---

## 🌟 What's New in v2.2.0

- 💾 **Settings Persistence (A):** All checkboxes, spinners, delays, and custom rules now auto-save using Burp's native Preferences API and are restored on next load.
- ⚡ **Parallel Fuzzing Mode (B):** Toggle `Parallel Mode` in the new **⚙ Settings & History** tab to send multiple requests simultaneously. Configurable thread count (2–20). Ordered collection preserves row numbering. Disables delay and session drift check.
- 📊 **Scan Summary (D):** Progress bar updates to a rich summary at end of scan — `Done! ✅ 147 sent | 12 interesting | 3 🎯 bypasses | Re-run available`.
- 🔍 **Response Diff Viewer (E):** Right-click any row → **Compare with Baseline** for a side-by-side HTML diff showing which lines changed between the baseline and the variant response.
- 📝 **Custom Detection Rules (G):** Define regex patterns in the Settings tab using `regex=LABEL` format. Matches in any response body are highlighted as `CUSTOM:LABEL` in the Notes column.
- 🔀 **Expanded Bypass Detection (H):** Now detects redirect-based bypasses (`🔀 REDIRECT BYPASS?` for 403→30x) and same-status body changes on 2xx (`⚠️ BODY_BYPASS?`).
- 🛡️ **Configurable WAF Threshold (I):** The WAF block threshold (consecutive connection resets before auto-stop) is now a spinner in Settings — default 5, range 1–50.
- 📋 **Scan History Tab (J):** A new **⚙ Settings & History** tab logs every completed scan with engine type, target URL, timestamp, payload count, interesting count, bypass count, and baseline status.
- 👁️ **Payload Preview (K):** Click **👁 Preview Payloads** on any engine tab to see a full categorized list of all variants that would be sent — without actually running the scan.

---

## 🌟 What's New in v2.1.0

- 🔧 **Thread Safety:** Fixed thread leak on extension unload via `taskExecutor.shutdownNow()`.
- 🖥️ **Swing EDT Fix:** `flashTab()` converted from raw `Thread.sleep()` to a proper `javax.swing.Timer`.
- ♻️ **DRY Refactor:** Eliminated 3× duplicate OPSEC panel code with `buildOpsecPanel()` helper.
- 📣 **Error Visibility:** All silently swallowed exceptions now log to `api.logging().logToError()`.
- 📂 **CSV Export Fix:** Export failure now shows an error dialog instead of failing silently.

---

## 🌟 What's New in v2.0 (The "Smart Fuzz" Update)

Access Context Fuzzer has been significantly upgraded to tackle modern web applications, aggressive WAFs, and complex API gateways:

- 🧠 **MD5 Body Hash Engine & "Interesting" Filter:** Detects hidden state changes (`BODY_DIFF`) even when the status code remains the same. Click **"🔍 Show Only Interesting"** to instantly filter out noise.
- 🛡️ **Adaptive Rate Limiting Anti-WAF:** Automatically doubles the delay upon `429 Too Many Requests` or `503`, and halts the scan if the WAF starts dropping connections (`status -1`).
- ⏱️ **Real-Time Fuzz Estimation:** The progress bar now dynamically estimates `(~1:45 remaining)` based on rolling RTT averages.
- 🔄 **Session Drift Detection:** Re-verifies your baseline every 50 requests. If your session expires (`SESSION_DRIFT`), it pauses the scan and warns you.
- 🗂️ **Bulk "Send to Repeater":** Multi-select support! Send all "Interesting" variants to the Repeater with a single click.
- 🎯 **Scan Profiles:** 1-click preset buttons (`⚡ Quick Scan`, `🔥 Full Scan`, `🎯 WCD Only`) instantly configure the payloads.
- 🧬 **Deep Protocol Injection:** Added WebDAV verbs, case-tampering (`gEt`), HTTP/2 pseudo-header injection (`:authority`), and obscure unicode traversals.

## ✨ Features

### 🔹 Three Fuzzing Engines

Access Context Fuzzer provides three independent fuzzing engines, each accessible via its own tab:

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/three_tabs.png" alt="Three Fuzzing Tabs" width="900"/>
</p>

---

### 1️⃣ Header Bypass

Tests access control enforcement by injecting **IP spoofing and host manipulation headers**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/header_bypass_tab.png" alt="Header Bypass Tab" width="900"/>
</p>

**What it tests:**

| Category | Headers | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|

| **Semicolon Suffix** | `Advanced Encoders` | `/admin;` | Parameter delimiter abuse |
| **X-Rewrite-URL** | `Rewrite Tricks` | Header: `/admin` | Frontend/backend path discrepancy |
| **X-Original-URL** | `Rewrite Tricks` | Header: `/admin` | URL override |
| **X-Accel-Redirect** | `Rewrite Tricks` | Header: `/admin` | **Nginx / OpenResty** internal redirect bypass |
| **Custom Paths** | — | User-defined paths | Load from wordlist file |

---

### 3️⃣ Selection Fuzz

Allows you to **select specific text** within a request and fuzz just that portion with various encodings.

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/selection_fuzz_tab.png" alt="Selection Fuzz Tab" width="900"/>
</p>

**What it tests:**

| Encoder | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **URL Encode** | Standard percent-encoding of selected text |
| **Double URL Encode** | Double-layer encoding |
| **IIS Unicode Encode** | IIS-specific Unicode mapping |
| **UTF-8 Fullwidth Slash** | Fullwidth character substitution |
| **Custom Payloads** | User-defined replacements from file or manual input |

**Use case:** When you've identified a specific parameter or path segment that might be vulnerable, select it and test encoding-specific bypasses.

<a id="web-cache-deception"></a>

### 🔹 Web Cache Deception (WCD) Testing

A dedicated 4-phase pipeline for discovering and exploiting Web Cache Deception vulnerabilities. Each phase maps directly to a checkbox in the **"Built-in Payloads"** panel:

> 📚 **New to Web Cache Deception?** Read the in-depth guide **[Web Cache Deception & Poisoning](https://tagmachan.com/web-cache-deception-and-poisoning.tagox)** to understand the theory behind every phase below before you start fuzzing.

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/wcd_settings.png" alt="WCD Settings Panel" width="900"/>
</p>

#### Phase 1: Delimiter Discovery
> 💡 **Checkbox:** `Delimiter Fuzzing`  |  **Config:** *Delimiter suffix* text field

Identifies which characters the **origin server** treats as path delimiters.

```
/my-account?abc        → 200 = '?' is a delimiter
/my-account#abc        → 200 = '#' is a delimiter
/my-account%23abc      → 200 = '%23' (encoded #) is a delimiter
/my-account%3fabc      → 200 = '%3f' (encoded ?) is a delimiter
```

#### Phase 2: Delimiter + Extension
> 💡 **Checkbox:** `Delimiter + Extension`

Tests if the **cache** treats responses differently when combined with static file extensions.

```
/my-account?abc.js     → Check X-Cache header
/my-account%23abc.css  → Check X-Cache header
```

#### Phase 3: Normalization Discrepancy
> 💡 **Checkbox:** `Normalization Discrepancy`  |  **Config:** *Cache directory prefix* text field

Tests whether the origin server and cache **handle encoded dot-segments differently**.

```
/aaa/..%2fmy-account           → 404 = origin doesn't normalize
/aaa/..%2fresources/test       → X-Cache:hit = cache DOES normalize!
/resources/..%2ftest           → No cache = confirms /resources prefix rule
```

#### Phase 4: Cache Deception Exploits
> 💡 **Checkbox:** `Cache Deception Combos`  |  **Config:** *Cache directory prefix* text field

Generates **combined exploit payloads** using discovered delimiters + cache normalization.

```
/my-account%23%2f%2e%2e%2fresources    → 200 + X-Cache:hit = EXPLOIT! 🎯
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/wcd_results.png" alt="WCD Results with X-Cache" width="900"/>
</p>

> **How WCD works:** The origin server sees `/my-account` (because `%23` is treated as `#` delimiter), but the cache sees `/resources` (after normalizing `..%2f`). The cache stores the authenticated response, and any attacker can read it from cache.

---

### 🔹 Smart Results Table

Every fuzzing result is displayed in an intelligent, color-coded table:

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/results_table.png" alt="Smart Results Table" width="900"/>
</p>

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **#** | Row index |
| **Variant** | Name of the test (e.g., `DELIM: '?'`, `WCD: '%23' + traversal`) |
| **Status** | HTTP status code |
| **Cache** | Cache status: `HIT ✅`, `MISS`, `PRIVATE 🚫`, `NO-STORE 🚫`, `HIT/Vary:Cookie`, or raw `X-Cache` value |
| **Words** | Word count of the response body |
| **Lines** | Line count of the response body |
| **Length** | Response body length in bytes |
| **Title** | Extracted HTML `<title>` tag |
| **RTT(ms)** | Round-trip time in milliseconds |
| **Notes** | Auto-detected anomalies and sensitive data matches |

**Automatic anomaly detection in Notes:**

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `SENSITIVE_DATA:JWT` | Response body contains a JWT token (also: `CSRF`, `EMAIL`, `BEARER`, `SECRET`) |
| `🎯 POTENTIAL BYPASS` | Baseline was a 40x error, but payload returned 2xx — strong bypass signal |
| `🔀 REDIRECT BYPASS?` | 401/403 baseline changed to a 30x redirect — possible auth bypass via redirect |
| `⚠️ BODY_BYPASS?` | Same 2xx status but body content changed — possible auth bypass with same code |
| `🔍 PATH_CONFUSION` | 404 baseline returned a non-404 response — path traversal or confusion |
| `CUSTOM:LABEL` | Response body matched a user-defined regex rule from the Settings tab |
| `STATUS_CHANGE` | Response status differs from baseline |
| `WORD_DELTA` | Word count differs from baseline |
| `LEN_DELTA` | Body length differs by >50 bytes |
| `BODY_DIFF` | MD5 hash of the response body differs from baseline despite same status |
| `RATE_LIMITED(429)` | Target is rate limiting. Delay automatically increased. |
| `⚠️ SESSION_DRIFT` | Original session is invalidated mid-scan |
| `X-Cache:hit` | Response served from cache |
| `X-Cache:miss` | Response not in cache (first request) |
| `CC:public,max-age=30` | Cache-Control header value |
| `Age:15` | Cache age in seconds |

**Color coding:**

- 🩷 **Pink rows** — Sensitive data in response body (`SENSITIVE_DATA:*`)
- 🟡 **Gold rows** — Potential bypass detected (`🎯 POTENTIAL BYPASS`)
- 🔵 **Sky-blue rows** — Redirect bypass hint (`🔀 REDIRECT BYPASS?`)
- 🟠 **Orange rows** — Body-based bypass hint (`⚠️ BODY_BYPASS?`)
- 🟣 **Lavender rows** — Custom rule match (`CUSTOM:LABEL`)
- 🟢 **Green rows** — 2xx Success response
- 💙 **Light Blue rows** — 3xx Redirects
- 🟡 **Light Yellow rows** — 429 Rate Limited
- 🔴 **Red rows** — 5xx Server errors
- ⚪ **Grey rows** — -1 Connection Resets (WAF dropping packets)

**Dynamic Sorting & Filtering:** 
Use the **"🔍 Show Only Interesting"** button to hide completely normal baseline-matching responses. Click any column header to instantly sort results by **Status Code**, **Word Count**, **Length**, or **RTT**. No need to scroll through hundreds of rows; **one click reveals your bypass**.

---

### 🔹 Request / Response Viewer

**Double-click** any row to open a dedicated inspection window powered by **Burp Suite's native HTTP editors** (`HttpRequestEditor` / `HttpResponseEditor` from the Montoya API). This is not a plain text viewer — it is the same editor component used in Burp's own Repeater and Proxy tabs.

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/request_response_viewer.png" alt="Request/Response Viewer" width="900"/>
</p>

The viewer opens as a **non-modal split pane** (request on the left, response on the right) with full tab support:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Raw** | Full HTTP message exactly as sent/received, including headers and body |
| **Pretty** | Syntax-highlighted, auto-formatted view (JSON, HTML, XML) |
| **Hex** | Byte-level hexadecimal view for binary analysis |
| **Render** | **Live HTML preview** of the response — instantly see if the page contains API keys, tokens, or sensitive data without reading raw HTML |

> 💡 You can open **multiple** viewer windows simultaneously to compare responses side by side. Each window is independent and stays open until you close it.

---

### 🔹 Re-run Fuzzing

Changed your settings? No need to go back to HTTP history — click **▶ Re-run Fuzzing** to re-execute with updated configuration.

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/rerun_button.png" alt="Re-run Fuzzing Button" width="600"/>
</p>

- ✅ Modify checkboxes, add custom payloads, change delay
- ✅ Click **▶ Re-run** — uses the same base request with new settings
- ✅ Previous results are cleared automatically

---

### 🔹 Load Wordlists from File

Every custom text area includes **📂 Load File** and **✕ Clear** buttons.

<p align="center">

</p>

- Supports `.txt`, `.lst`, `.csv`, `.list` files
- **Appends** to existing content (combine manual + file payloads)
- Shows line count feedback after loading
- Works with all custom fields: IPs, Headers, Paths, Payloads

---

### 🔹 OPSEC & Network Safety

Each tab includes an **IP verification check** to ensure your traffic is properly anonymized.

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/opsec_check.png" alt="OPSEC Check" width="600"/>
</p>

- Click **Check External IP** to verify your public IP
- **OPSEC Warning Dialog** — if you haven't verified your IP, the extension **blocks fuzzing** and shows a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental exposure of your real IP
- Configurable **delay (ms)** between requests to avoid rate limiting and WAF detection

---

### 🔹 Export & Integration

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| **Send to Repeater** | Extensively supports Multi-select (`Ctrl`+Click, `Shift`+Click). Right-click to find **"Send All Selected"** or **"Send All Interesting"**. |
| **Export CSV** | Click *Export CSV* to save all tabular results |
| **Site Map** | All fuzzing requests are natively integrated and added to Burp's Site Map |

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start

1. Browse to your target in Burp's built-in browser
2. Find a request in **Proxy → HTTP History**
3. Right-click the request and choose:

| Menu Item | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Access Context: Header Fuzz** | Testing header-based access control (IP restrictions, host checks) |
| **Access Context: Path Fuzz** | Testing path-based access control (URL normalization, encoding bypass) |
| **Access Context: Fuzz Selection** | Testing a specific selected portion of the request |

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/context_menu.png" alt="Context Menu" width="500"/>
</p>

4. The extension switches to the appropriate tab and begins fuzzing
5. Watch the progress bar and results table populate in real-time
6. Look for **green highlighted rows** with `STATUS_CHANGE` or `WORD_DELTA` in Notes

### Workflow: Web Cache Deception Lab

A step-by-step guide for testing WCD vulnerabilities:

```
Step 1: Enable "Delimiter Fuzzing" checkbox
        → Find delimiters that return 200 (e.g., ?, #, %23)

Step 2: Enable "Delimiter + Extension" checkbox
        → Check Notes column for X-Cache headers

Step 3: Enable "Norm Discrepancy" checkbox
        → Set Cache Prefix to "/resources"
        → Find normalization differences between origin and cache

Step 4: Enable "Cache Deception Combos" checkbox
        → Look for rows with Status=200 AND X-Cache:hit
        → That row's path is your exploit payload!

Step 5: Double-click the exploit row
        → Verify API key / sensitive data in the Render tab
        → Copy the path for your exploit server
```
